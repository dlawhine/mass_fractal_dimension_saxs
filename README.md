This is an example of a 2D Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) plot from aggregates of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in aqueous solution.
Data fitting has been previously carried out with a model of mass fractals.
The code in the .py file plots the two datasets (experimental data and fitted data) in the .txt files.
The figure (.png and .pdf files) also displays characteristic regions from the model.
